I know the ShowAllScores procedure doesn't print the raw scores for each assignment and course average to two decimal places on a single line for a given SID and instead prints multiple lines per table.

I did try many ways using both sql and php to change the format but was unable to make it work. One of my implementations had all of the attributes on one row but only printed the information for the first SID when given the correct password.

Because of this I tried using a cursor to call the procedure I used in ShowRawScores with each SID. I was unable to get this working but left the code commented out in my HW4_ShowAllScores.php and HW4_ShowAllScores.sql files to show what I attempted and to hopefully get some partial credit if what I have is it's close.
